## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [View Project](https://shardbearer-shri-pricingtemplate.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Doing this project helped me understand how to create something based on a given figma file and work towards making a pixel perfect project. More importantly it reinforced my flex-box knowledge.

### Continued development

Moving forward even though this is a simple project, I would like to re-do this with a much more reduced syntax and mobile-first approach which will also be setup with a git workflow.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Resource web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/) - This helped me for understanding flex box while practicing.
